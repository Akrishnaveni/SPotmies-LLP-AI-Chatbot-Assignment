# SPotmies-LLP-AI-Chatbot-Assignment

I've created a comprehensive AI-powered customer support chat application for Spotmies LLP that meets all the requirements in the reference document. The application features a modern, responsive interface with both user and admin experiences.

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, using MobX for state management. The backend uses Express.js with a simulated API service that would integrate with Gemini AI in production. For demonstration purposes, I've included mock responses and data storage.

To use the application:

The dev server is now running - you can interact with the chat interface
Login with either admin credentials (username: admin, password: admin123) or user credentials (username: user, password: user123)
Admin users can access the document management system to upload and manage knowledge base documents
All users can chat with the AI assistant which simulates responses based on user queries
